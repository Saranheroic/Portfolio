# Gemini 2.5: The New Benchmark Leader in AI

**Vanakam!** In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, Google's latest marvel, **Gemini 2.5**, has set a new standard. Let's delve into how this model outshines its peers and offers exceptional value.

## Benchmark Performance

According to [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models), Gemini 2.5 has achieved top rankings across various metrics:

- **Intelligence**: Gemini 2.5 leads with superior reasoning capabilities.
- **Performance**: It boasts impressive output speed and minimal latency.
- **Context Window**: With a 1-million token context window, it surpasses many competitors.

These accolades underscore Gemini 2.5's dominance in the AI landscape.

## Pricing Comparison

Understanding the cost-effectiveness of AI models is crucial. Here's a comparison based on data from [Google's Gemini 2.5](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#enhanced-reasoning):

# LLM Price Comparison

## Gemini 2.5
- **Input Cost:** $0.10 per 1M tokens  
- **Output Cost:** $0.40 per 1M tokens  
- **Context Window:** 1M tokens  

## GPT-4o
- **Input Cost:** $0.12 per 1M tokens  
- **Output Cost:** $0.50 per 1M tokens  
- **Context Window:** 128K tokens  

## Claude 2
- **Input Cost:** $0.11 per 1M tokens  
- **Output Cost:** $0.45 per 1M tokens  
- **Context Window:** 200K tokens  

### Conclusion:
-  **Gemini 2.5 is the most affordable** and has the **largest context window (1M tokens)**.  
-  **Claude 2 offers mid-range pricing** but a decent 200K context window.  
-  **GPT-4o is the most expensive** with a smaller 128K token context window.  

**pros:** Gemini 2.5 provides the **best price-to-performance ratio**, making it a great choice for long-context applications.
